package cells;
/*		Author: Zak Gray and Tim Dobeck
 * 		Description: This is the constuctor for determining the SECOND board's cells. The cells in layer 2 can be only red or blue. This class mainly just
 * 					creates the instance of the cells in layer 2. FlipColor allows the color to be flipped if any cell is clicked. This class extends GenCell 
 * 					which is an abstract class that creates the cells as rectangles
 * 		Parameters: Cell_2 is made up of an x coordinate, a y coordinate, a fixed size, and a color and for this class (layer 2) the cells can only be either 
 * 					red or blue.
 * 					contains is made up of Point p which is a specific x and y coordinate. It is used in dtermining the location of the cells in layer 1 for 
 * 					determining what the cells will be for layer 2.
