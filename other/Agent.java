/*		Author: Nick Corrado and Tim Dobeck
 * 		Description: This is the constructor class for the Agents to be created and drawn. Velocity determined the direction each agent will move and
 * 		Color is for determining if the color of the agent will be green or invisible. The rest of the agents are being made because it is extending the
 * 		Rectangle2D superclass.
 * 		Parameters: Agent is made up of its x coordinate, y coordinate, fixed size of agent, Point2D is the direction the agent will move, and color of agent
 * 					Draw is made up of Graphics g which is the type for drawing things in a JPanel
 * 					SetColor is made up of the specific color of the agent, this is called in the Board class
 * 					Both setVelocity's determine a new x and y coordinate for the Agents to have after they step
 * 					SetX and SetY determines where each agent will be placed originally
